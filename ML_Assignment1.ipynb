    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial intelligence. It involves development of alogorthims and models that helps computers learn and improve their performance. It is way to teach computers to recognize patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns --> helps to generalise the data. It uses mathematics and statistical techniques to extract insights from data."
