    "Yes, it is possible to distribute a bagging ensemble's training through several servers to speed up the process. This can be done by training the individual models on different servers in parallel, and then combining their outputs to make the final prediction. The same approach can be used for pasting ensembles, boosting ensembles, Random Forests, and stacking ensembles."

    "The main difference between Extra-Trees and ordinary Random Forests is that Extra-Trees introduce additional randomness in the way they choose the splitting points. Instead of searching for the best possible threshold for each feature, Extra-Trees choose random thresholds.\n"
